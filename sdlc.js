// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const AnalysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, in which the end goal is to understand all of the software requirements. Developers try to analyze how the software should work as well as how the users will be using it. Stories are often created during this stage."
const Design = "This is the third step, in which developers create the initial high-level design for the software and system."
const Implementation = "This is the fourth step, in which developers create or code the software as per the established guidelines."
const TestAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step, in which developers QA the software to make sure it meets the requirements outlined in the planning phase. Once the QA has finished the software is released to the user."
const Maintain = "This is the sixth step, in which developers create a plan to maintain the software and stick to it post-production. This is an ongoing stage in which bugs are fixed and software is updated."
